Aparna, a 37-year-old lawyer from Houston, was perhaps the most talked about cast member in 2020 after she hired Mumbai-based matchmaker Sima Taparia to find her a husband. Sima called Aparna fickle-minded and thought she was rude. After all, Aparna had a never-ending list of things she hated about people. Aparna met Srinivas Rao, Shekhar Jayaraman, and Jay Wadhwani through Sima Aunty in Indian Matchmaking season 1.</p><p><a href=#>Aparna and Jay were together in Indian Matchmaking</a> season 1, and he even introduced her to his friend. However, in Indian Matchmaking season 2, Aparna revealed she had decided to stay friends with Jay. He even helped her move to New York City and set up a new house. Jay eventually got engaged to Stephanie Robbins, with his and Aparna's friendship still going strong. Aparna then started exploring a long-distance relationship with Daman Baath in Indian Matchmaking season 2.</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-aparna-amp-sima-on-indian-matchmaking>What Happened Between Aparna & Sima On Indian Matchmaking?</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Today</a>, <a href=#>Indian Matchmaking star Aparna</a> revealed, “Sima and I did have a breakup, and it was about where our values didn’t align.” According to Aparna, tensions arose when Sima realized Aparna was more “progressive.” Aparna viewed partnerships between men and women as equal “if it’s a heterosexual woman.” Aparna admitted she did not see eye to eye with Sima on a lot of things surrounding their Indian culture. Aparna didn't think anything of it as she didn’t expect everyone to agree with her views. “It was just a very sensible break for me,” Aparna added.</p><h2 id=why-aparna-was-not-on-indian-matchmaking-season-3>Why Aparna Was Not On Indian Matchmaking Season 3</h2><p>Since she was a popular cast member in Indian Matchmaking season 1 and is still single, she was brought back for another season. In Indian Matchmaking season 2, Aparna left Houston, moved to New York City, and unsuccessfully dated Jay. However, she then met a man she met through Sima Aunty and went on a date with a friend’s cousin, Daman, only to yawn in the middle of it. Aparna then decided to focus on herself and not make any major decisions about finding a life partner. Since Aparna may have wanted to keep her dating life private after two unsuccessful seasons, she didn't want to be on another season.</p><h2 id=did-aparna-from-indian-matchmaking-get-married>Did Aparna From Indian Matchmaking Get Married?</h2><p>According to <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Aparna is still living life on her own terms and has made herself a priority. “I’m focused on living my best life and making myself happy so that I am the very best version of myself and can be an amazing partner when the right guy does come along,” said Aparna in her interview. Aparna from Indian Matchmaking does not have a husband in 2023. Aparna was the most hated cast member from the first season but get a lot of praise for speaking her mind and for how she dealt with terrible dates. The show didn't help Aparna get married, but <strong>Indian Matchmaking</strong> changed her life.</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aparna Shewakramani</a>/Instagram</p>Related Topics About The Author<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk6eyprrRmqWtZpOkunC1zZ2gmqZdoq61r8emmKShnpx6orzAq6WaZaOdsrityquYppmennq2vMOaq55n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2findian-matchmaking-aparna-shewakramani-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2findian-matchmaking-aparna-shewakramani-update.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2findian-matchmaking-aparna-shewakramani-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2findian-matchmaking-aparna-shewakramani-update.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2findian-matchmaking-aparna-shewakramani-update.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2findian-matchmaking-aparna-shewakramani-update.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./oqq-tank-top-set-sale-amazon-7563821.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./oqq-tank-top-set-sale-amazon-7563821.html>34DDD-Cup Shoppers &amp;quot;Dont Need to Wear a Bra&amp;quot; With QQQ Tank Tops</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./richard-john-russell.html>Richard John Russell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./richard-john-russell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

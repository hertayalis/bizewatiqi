But she also got a little spice to her so I like being around her," this season's lead gushed to cameras about the Nashville native.</p><p>After Christina opened up about being divorced and having a five-year-old daughter named Blakely, he explained that he doesn’t know if he’s ready to be a father and said he was "terrified" by the prospect.</p><p>At the end of their date, Zach decided to give her a rose and keep her around since he thinks "she’s worth it."</p><h2><strong>WHAT'S TO COME</strong></h2><p>The drama for what's to come was teased at the end of Monday's episode when Brianna Thorbourne confronted Christina over a comment she made - the latter told her: "I hate you."</p><p>Christina apologized, but Brianna still felt the need to bring it up to Zach, who didn't want to be part of the drama.</p><p>In a preview for February 6th's episode, the contestants share their feelings about Barbara Mandrell's niece.</p><p>"Christina's trying to intimidate," one stated, while another said: "Anyone who she perceives as a threat is going to be a target."</p><p>Another girl commented: "She needs to be exposed."</p><p>Christina is then seen crying and hyperventilating on the mansion's staircase.</p><h2><strong>'LOVES THE SPOTLIGHT'</strong></h2><p>"She really was the one who right off the bat stood out as not being there for the right reason," the source confessed to The U.S. Sun.</p><p>The U.S. Sun previously talked to Christina's ex-husband Blake Dennis, who said he <a href=#>"wasn't surprised" that she signed up</a> for the show.</p><p>"She definitely does [love being in the spotlight]. I mean, I can kind of say her whole family does.</p><p>"Christina used to have&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;watch parties when we were together and, you know, it's not surprising to me at all," Blake explained.</p><p>The former couple got married in May 2015 and she&nbsp;<a href=#>filed for divorce</a>&nbsp;five years later in December 2020.</p><p>The <a href=#>Pink Lily fashion model</a> and actress appeared in Hannah Montana: The Movie, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>'s Fifteen music video, and Cole Swindell's She Had Me At Heads Carolina music video.</p><p>Another insider previously told The U.S. Sun that she's "so natural" in front of cameras and "it comes so easy to her."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Whatever she sets her mind to, she will get it," the insider dished.</p><p>"She's very persistent...

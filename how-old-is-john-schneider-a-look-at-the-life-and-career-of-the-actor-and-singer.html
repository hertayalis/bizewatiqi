It followed the adventures of the Duke cousins, who drove around in their iconic orange Dodge Charger named the General Lee, often getting into trouble with the law and their nemesis, Boss Hogg. The show made John Schneider a household name and a teen idol. He also sang the theme song of the show, “Good Ol’ Boys”, written by Waylon Jennings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Country Music Career and Other Acting Roles</strong></h2><p>While starring in The Dukes of Hazzard, John Schneider also pursued a career in country music.

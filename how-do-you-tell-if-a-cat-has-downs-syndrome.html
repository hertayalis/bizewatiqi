When exposed to prenatal valproate (VPA) during pregnancy, the mice are born with basic deformities and the developmental delays seen symptomatically in humans5.<h2>Is my cat on the spectrum?</h2>Some cats get overstimulated — a hallmark of an autistic diagnosis. Some overstimulation signs to look for are dilated pupils, flat ears, and biting motions.

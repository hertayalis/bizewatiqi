昨年大ヒットを記録したドラマ「逃げ恥」にて共演し、
息のあった演技を披露し、話題となりした。
星野源さんの「恋ダンス」もヒットして、
昨年は彼の年といっても過言ではないほど話題を集めました。
そして、ドラマの中で共演して星野源さんと新垣結衣さんですが、
ドラマが始まって早々、現場での雰囲気が良い話されてました。
星野が新垣の印象を「すごく一緒にいて楽しいですし、スタジオに入る前はそこに佇んでいる姿は普通の女の子なのに、カメラの前に立つとわっとスターというか…」と感心すれば、星野の方をくるりと向き直った新垣は「もういいです。長い！」とピシャリ。すっかり夫婦役として息ピッタリな様子をみせていた。 引用元：http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2079403/full/
星野源さんは新垣さんを女優として尊敬しており、
新垣さんも星野さんのことをスター歌手として尊敬しているそうです。
互いに互いを認め合い、
さらには人間的にも相性が良かったそうです。
ドラマの中では「契約結婚」する二人ですが、
撮影以外の時間も幸せだとして、
一緒にいる撮影現場が楽しくて仕方なかったようです。
そして、何よりすごいのが、
星野源さんのファンが新垣さんを気に入り、
新垣さんのファンも星野源さんのことを気に入ってることです。
「逃げ恥」が始まって早々、
互いのファンが二人の熱愛を、
心のどこかで期待していたようです。
まさかにGTOの反町さんと松嶋さんの頃と、
似たような空気だったといえます。
果たして星野源さんと新垣結衣さんが、
熱愛に発展する可能性はあったのでしょうか？
星野源と新垣結衣の熱愛彼女への希望(2ch)。文春やフライデーの可能性 放送されたから１年が経とうとしてますが、
結論からすると、まだ星野源さんと新垣結衣さんに熱愛報道はありません。
最近では文春とフライデーが飛ばしていますが、
その大手２社でさえ、二人の熱愛疑惑は取り上げていません。
それでも、ドラマでの雰囲気が良すぎて、
多くのファンが二人のロマンスを夢見てしまっています。
互いに清楚で嫌味もなく、真面目でおしとやか・・・。
ドラマが始まる前のインタビューも、始まった後のインタビューでも、
さらにはドラマが終わった後のインタビューでさえ、
星野源さんと新垣結衣さんは互いを褒めあっています。
本当に女性と男性として一線を超えていないのでしょうか？
同ドラマのインタビューで、新垣は星野について「今までの印象は明るくて、キラキラした方だと思っていましたが、今テンションを合わせてくださって普通にお話してくださるというか、そんなに撮影が始まってまだ日にちがたっていないときから、自然に歩調を合わせてお話してくださる方です」とコメントしており、星野もまた新垣について「会うまではキラキラしたスターというイメージだったんですが、実際にお会いしたら、すごく普通の可愛い女の子で。それがとても素敵だと思いました。大スターなのに、まったく気取っていないし、話しかけたらフレンドリーに話し返してくれるし、かといって人の領域に踏み込むようなことも決してしない。普通ということを忘れない人。すごく素敵です」（引用：インタビュー｜TBSテレビ：火曜ドラマ『逃げるは恥だが役に立つ』）と語っているように、ドラマの中のみくりと平匡の関係に近いものが伺える。新垣と星野が“契約結婚”という微妙な距離感を、初々しくもどこかドライな芝居で演じられるのは、お互いを尊重できる関係性がすでに出来上がっているからだろう。引用元：http://realsound.jp/movie/2016/11/post-3116_2.html
新垣さんは星野源さんに対して、
協調性があって、空気を合わせてくれる部分が素敵だと語り、
星野源さんは新垣さんに対して、
可愛く気取りもなく、対人関係の距離が素敵だと語っています。
互いの話を冷静に考えてみると、
男女というよりも、人として、仕事するパートナーとして、
互いを尊敬しあってるだけなようにも見えます。
しかし、それでもドラマの中で見る二人のツーショットは素敵で、
このカップルが現実に存在したら、いかに素晴らしいか・・・。
これは互いのファンの夢のままに終わってしまうのでしょうか？
あの2chでさえ、二人が熱愛してた場合に、
肯定的なコメントを出しそうな空気があります。
何が特別に良いというよりも、
悪いところがどこにもないってことが、
この二人の関係の素敵な部分なのかもしれません。
星野源さんと新垣結衣さんは、
雰囲気と人間性がぴったりなだけでなく、
仕事の過程なども被ってる部分があったりするのです。
